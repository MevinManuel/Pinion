📍 Pinion

**Pinion** is a Geo-Based Storytelling App that allows users to pin personal stories, experiences, or thoughts to real-world locations. It transforms maps into a canvas of shared memories and local tales.

## 🗺️ What is Pinion?

Pinion is designed to connect people through places. Whether it’s a hidden beach story, a college memory, or a historical fact—users can add location-based pins with rich context and content. Think of it as a digital memory map.

## 🔥 Features

- 🗺️ **Interactive Google Map Integration**  
  A seamless and responsive map interface using **Google Maps SDK**, allowing users to pan, zoom, and explore locations with ease.

- 📍 **Custom Location-Based Pins**  
  Users can tap anywhere on the map to drop a pin and attach a short story, memory, or note to that exact location.

- 📝 **Story Creation & Preview**  
  Each pin includes a form to enter a title and a detailed description. Pins are saved and can be revisited or edited later (persistent storage to be added).

- 🎨 **Clean & Minimal UI**  
  Designed with user experience in mind—distraction-free layout with focus on storytelling and interaction.

- 📱 **Mobile-first Experience**  
  Fully optimized for Android devices. Can be run via USB for local development, with plans for production builds.

- 📦 **Modular Codebase**  
  The app is structured for easy extension—whether adding authentication, backend support, or map providers like OpenStreetMap in the future.
